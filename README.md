# Data Visualization Techniques in Smart Agriculture

This project leverages data visualization to optimize agricultural practices by converting sensor data into comprehensible visual tools. The focus is on enhancing water management and crop health in the cotton farming region of Matiari.üåæ

## Features

- **Real-time Data Collection:** Collects real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters using IoT sensors.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the collected data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and detect outliers.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for predicting water scheduling and crop health.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Implements histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize trends and relationships in the data.
- **Improved Decision-Making:** Helps farmers make informed decisions on irrigation planning and crop management by identifying patterns and potential issues early on.
